# Introducing Tidyverse

**Tidyverse** is a collection of R packagesthat share common philosophies andare designed to work together fordoing data science.

### Installing and loading Tidyverse

The code chunk below performs the following three tasks:
+ Create a packaging list called packages.
+ Check if the package(s) on the list have been installed in R, if they have yet to be installedthen go ahead to install the missing package(s).
+ Launch the packages in R using library().

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'readxl')

for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# The readr Package

**readr** is one of the tidyverse package.

+ The goal of **readr** is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, andfwf).
+ It is designed to flexibly parse many types of datafound in the wild, while still cleanly failing whendata unexpectedly changes.

## Importing Data

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
orders <- read_xls("data/Superstore-2021.xls",
                   sheet = "Orders")
returns <- read_xls("data/Superstore-2021.xls",
                   sheet = "Returns")
```

## Preparing the Data

### Combine

```{r}
joined_tab <- left_join(returns, orders,
                        by = c('Order ID' = 'Order ID'))
```

### Compute the frequency count by Sub-Category

```{r}
FC_tab <- joined_tab %>%
  group_by('Sub-Category') %>%
  summarise('Returns' = count(as.factor('Sub-Category'))) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
freq_returned <- joined_tab %>%
  count("Sub-Category")
```

```{r}
freq_returned <- freq_returned %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
freq_returned$cumulative <- cumsum(freq_returned$n)
```
